# Ploidy Assay Analysis Output

This directory contains the output files and figures generated by the ploidy discrepancy analysis script.

## Output Files

### ploidy_comparison_with_ambiguous_gate.csv

The main output file containing the complete comparison of benomyl assay and flow cytometry results for all wells. Key columns include:

- `well_id`: The standardized well identifier (e.g., "WGS1A1")
- `benomyl_says_diploid`: Whether the benomyl assay indicates diploid (TRUE/FALSE)
- `flow_says_diploid`: Whether flow cytometry indicates diploid (TRUE/FALSE)
- `agreement`: Whether the two methods agree (TRUE/FALSE)
- `benomyl_is_borderline`: Whether the benomyl result is borderline (TRUE/FALSE)
- `flow_mixed_population`: Whether flow cytometry indicates a mixed population (TRUE/FALSE)
- `flow_haploid_percent`: Percentage of cells in the haploid gate
- `flow_diploid_percent`: Percentage of cells in the diploid gate
- `flow_ambiguous_percent`: Percentage of cells in the ambiguous gate (could be either G2 haploid or G1 diploid)
- `disagreement_type`: Type of disagreement (if applicable)
- `disagreement_explanation`: Potential explanation for disagreement (if applicable)

## Using These Files

- For a comprehensive view of all results, use `ploid_comparison_with_ambiguous_gate.csv`
- For a high-level summary, refer to `ploidy_comparison_summary.txt`
- To focus on specific types of disagreements, examine the specialized discrepancy CSV files

## Interpreting Cell Distribution

In the flow cytometry data:
- **Haploid gate**: Cells with clear haploid DNA content
- **Diploid gate**: Cells with clear diploid DNA content
- **Ambiguous gate**: Cells that could be haploid G2 or diploid G1
